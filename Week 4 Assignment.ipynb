The number of words might be huge, so it would be reasonable to filter them, for example, by frequency and leave only the frequent ones.

        " - First, we should create two [helpers](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_guides/python/contrib.seq2seq#Dynamic_Decoding). These classes help to determine the behaviour of the decoder. During the training time, we will use [TrainingHelper](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/seq2seq/TrainingHelper). For the inference we recommend to use [GreedyEmbeddingHelper](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/seq2seq/GreedyEmbeddingHelper).\n",
        " - To share all parameters during training and inference, we use one scope and set the flag 'reuse' to True at inference time. You might be interested to know more about how [variable scopes](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/variables) work in TF. \n",
        " - To create the decoder itself, we will use [BasicDecoder](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/seq2seq/BasicDecoder) class. As previously, you should choose some RNN cell, e.g. GRU cell. To turn hidden states into logits, we will need a projection layer. One of the simple solutions is using [OutputProjectionWrapper](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/rnn/OutputProjectionWrapper).\n",
        " - For getting the predictions, it will be convinient to use [dynamic_decode](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/seq2seq/dynamic_decode). This function uses the provided decoder to perform decoding."
